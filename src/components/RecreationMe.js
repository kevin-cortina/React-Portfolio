        Recreational work includes many things involving real estate, and techonology. Outside of working, some of my main recrecational activities include going hiking, fishing, clamming, and going to the gym. When I am not out into the world I like to spend time with my 2 dogs, Ezekeial and Ezreal where we watch tv shows and movies.
